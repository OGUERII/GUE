<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>(possibly informal outside attributive use) The World Wide Web.
The dirty secret of the internet is that all this distraction and interruption is immensely profitable. Web companies like to boast about "creating compelling content", or offering services that let you "stay up to date with what your friends are doing" [ â€¦] and so on. But the real way to build a successful online business is to be better than your rivals at undermining people's control of their own attention.</p>
